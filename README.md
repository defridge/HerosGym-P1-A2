# Heros Gym

The Heros Gym website is designed to give potential members an overview of the gym and what we are all about! Heros Gym offers “big gym” state of the art equipment and classes but with a “small gym” welcoming and encouraging atmosphere.

Using this website you will be able to find all relevant information about the gym including opening and closing times, the class timetable and descriptions of the classes we teach and a gallery showcasing the gym layout and equipment available. There is also a form section where potential members can register their interest and will be sent membership pricing.

### Gallery Page

- The gallery page allows the webiste user to see how the gym is layed out, the overall size of the ground floor and first floor, and pictures of the equipment in the gym.
- A picture speaks a 1000 words so other then the heading on this page there is no other text.
- Depending on screen size the images will arrange themselves into 1, 2, or 4 columns.
